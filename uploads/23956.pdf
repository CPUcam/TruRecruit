    rotation = .5 * (60sec/15,000rpm) * 1000ms/sec
    rotation ~ 2ms
    Transfer = (60sec/15,000rpm) * 1/500sectors/track * 1,000ms/sec
    Transfer ~ .008ms
    Access = seek + rotation + transfer
           = 8ms + 2ms + .008ms
           ~ 10.008ms

    1. Read the inode for / from a fixed location
    2. Read the first data block for root
    3. Read the inode for usr/
    4. Read the first data block for usr/
    5. Read the inode for jane/
    6. Read the first data block for jane/
    7. Read the inode for classes/
    ...
    11. Read the inode for exam_study_notes.txt
    12. Write data to the file
        - Copies buffer into file

    I don't think it is fundamentally necessary to 
    store the info about unallocated disk sectors
    on the disk. That information can be stored in
    a cache or RAM. This would be more volatile 
    and would last less time than a disk, but the
    data can be refreshed before it is lost.

    The impact on performance would not be 
    significant because the file system would
    only check the replica inode array if the other
    failed. Backups are usually a good idea.

5.

    A journaling file system keeps track of changes 
    and expected future changes using a journal. 
    This allows crashes to be less catastrophic by 
    allowing the OS to read the state of the disk 
    at crash from the journal, instead of having to 
    read from a root.
